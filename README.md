# DataFest 2019

## Problem Statement
We participated in the 2019 ASA DataFest at UCLA, where teams were challenged to analyze data from the Canada women's national rugby union team towards the goal of redefining athlete fatigue. 

## Our Approach
We decided to redefine fatigue using k-means clustering based on subjective player wellness scores. Then, we examined how our definition of fatigue impacted on-field results.

## Results
Out of 75+ teams competing from universities across Southern California, we were chosen by the judges to advance to the Finalist's round.
